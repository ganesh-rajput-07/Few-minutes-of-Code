# Minimum Number of Jumps to Reach End

You are given an array `arr[]` of non-negative numbers. Each number tells you the **maximum number of steps** you can jump forward from that position.

## Jump Rules:
- If `arr[i] = 3`, you can jump to index `i + 1`, `i + 2`, or `i + 3` from position `i`.
- If `arr[i] = 0`, you cannot move forward from that position.

Your task is to **find the minimum number of jumps** needed to move from the first position in the array to the last position.

If it is not possible to reach the end of the array, return `-1`.

## Examples:

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
- First jump from the 1st element to the 2nd element (value = 3).  
- From here, jump to the 5th element (value = 9).  
- From here, jump to the last element.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
- First jump from the 1st to the 2nd element.  
- Then jump directly to the last element.

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`arr = [0, 10, 20]`  
**Output:**  
`-1`  
**Explanation:**  
- You cannot move anywhere from the 1st element.

---

## Constraints:
- `2 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10^4`
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4`

## Solution to this Problem is :

```
class Solution:
    def minJumps(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        if n <= 1:
            return 0
        if arr[0] == 0:
            return -1

        maxReach = arr[0]
        steps = arr[0]
        jumps = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            if i == n - 1:
                return jumps

            maxReach = max(maxReach, i + arr[i])
            steps -= 1

            if steps == 0:
                jumps += 1
                if i >= maxReach:
                    return -1
                steps = maxReach - i

        return -1
```
